Hi! I'm Siqi (Cindy) Zeng, a 2nd year Ph.D.  at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign advised by the great [Prof. Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/).
I'm currently working on model merging of foundational models (e.g., large vision/language models), and have also explored hierarchical learning, optimal transport. Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University working with [Prof. Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/) and [Prof. Hoda Hedari](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hheidari/) on the topic of AI for social good.

My office is at SC 3405, feel free to stop by and say hi :)
